The following video will explain in detail the capabilities of the Ritual Designer, and how to use them:


At the top of the main page you will see 3 fields: Days to Complete, Ritual Title, and Global Rune Reps.
The first 2 are self explanatory. Global Rune Reps are directly related to adding runes to your ritual, which will be explained below.

In the "Steps" section, you will see a button with a plus ("+") icon. Clicking this will allow you to add a step to your ritual,
giving you 3 options to choose from: Rune, Affirmation, and Meditation.
<br />
### Rune
***
The Rune step will allow you to choose a rune, along with the number of repititions the rune needs to be vibrated for.

By checking "Use Global Reps," the number will change to match the Global Rune Reps value that is set on the main page.
This can let you easily modify the number of reps for many runes at once by changing that value on the main page.
<br />
### Affirmation
***
In the Affirmation step, you can enter text which the user will be prompted to affirm during the ritual.
Set the number of reps, as well as the type of affirmation: If the text only contains words meant to be affirmed without vibration,
check "Affirm." If it only contains words that are meant to be vibrated, such as "AUM," check "Vibrate." If it contains both types,
check "Both."

You will notice a BBCode menu appears above the text area while selected. You can change the color of text, its size,
make it bold or italicized, etc.

### Meditation
***
The Meditation step displays instructions which are not meant to be affirmed or vibrated. For example,
"Meditate in silence for 1 minute."

"Display text" will be shown above these instructions. "Finished text" will be shown
on the button that is to be pressed once this step has been completed.
