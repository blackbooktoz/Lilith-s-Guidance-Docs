The following video will explain in detail the capabilities of the Ritual Designer, and how to use them:


At the top of the main page you will see 3 fields: Days to Complete, Ritual Title, and Global Rune Reps.
The first 2 are self explanatory. Global Rune Reps are directly related to adding runes to your ritual, which will be explained below.

In the "Steps" section, you will see a button with a plus ("+") icon. Clicking this will allow you to add a step to your ritual,
giving you 3 options to choose from: Rune, Affirmation, and Meditation.

You can add as many steps as you need - a scroll bar will appear to accomodate large numbers of steps.
<br />
### Rune
***
The Rune step will allow you to choose a rune, along with the number of repititions the rune needs to be vibrated for.

By checking "Use Global Reps," the number will change to match the Global Rune Reps value that is set on the main page.
This can let you easily modify the number of reps for many runes at once by changing that value on the main page.
<br />
### Affirmation
***
In the Affirmation step, you can enter text which the user will be prompted to affirm during the ritual.
Set the number of reps, as well as the type of affirmation: If the text only contains words meant to be affirmed without vibration,
check "Affirm." If it only contains words that are meant to be vibrated, such as "AUM," check "Vibrate." If it contains both types,
check "Both."

You will notice a BBCode menu appears above the text area while selected. You can change the color of text, its size,
make it bold or italicized, etc.

<br />
### Meditation
***
The Meditation step displays instructions which are not meant to be affirmed or vibrated. For example,
"Meditate in silence for 1 minute."

"Display text" will be shown above these instructions. "Finished text" will be shown
on the button that is to be pressed once this step has been completed.
<br />
### Side Panel
***
In all of these steps, you will see on the left side of the interface a panel labeled "Side Panel."
Pressing "Edit" will show you the Side Panel Layout for this particular step.

The left side of this interface is for the Instructions Panel, and the right is for the Media Panel.

The Instructions Panel displays supplemental text for the ritual step. For example, pronunciation instructions can be listed here.

For the Rune step, this side of the panel is not editable as it will always show how to pronounce the runes.

Beneath the Instructions text box, you will also see and area to add Audio. Audio can be added with or without text instructions.
If there are also text instructions, the audio player will be displayed below these instructions.

The Media panel displays an image or video. Press "Add Media," which will open an interface with a "Browse" button.
Browse your device's files for the desired media file and select it. You can then adjust the scale of the media.

The "Quick Add" button in the Media and Audio sections allows you to quickly add media or audio files which are found
within your save files from your other ritual templates.
<br />
### Copy From...
***
The "Copy From..." button is present for every step type. This will let you copy the settings from another of your steps,
including sidepanel settings.

If the step being copied from is not the same step type, then only the sidepanel settings will be copied.
<br />
### Templates
***
At the bottom-left of the Ritual Designer you will see 2 buttons labeled Save Template and Load Template.

Save Template will create a save file for your ritual, also creating copies of the media and audio you have added to your step(s).

Load Template will show you a list of all of the templates in your save files. Selecting one will load all of its details into the
Ritual Designer, allowing you to edit it.
<br />
### Create Ritual
***
In the bottom-middle of the Ritual Designer, you will see a "Create Ritual" button.

If you have not saved your template yet, it will first prompt you to do so. Then, your ritual will start
and be added to your active rituals.
<br />
### Importing & Exporting
***
In the bottom-right of the Ritual Designer, you will see 2 buttons labeled Import and Export.

The Export button creates a ZIP file containing your ritual's template and all of its associated files.
This ZIP file can then be shared with others.

The Import button will allow you to browse your device and select a ZIP file containing an exported ritual template.
Importing a ritual template will add an exact copy of the ritual to your save files.

By exporting your templates and sharing them, and importing templates others have shared,
rituals can be shared easily amongst the community as well as be modified to suit one's exact needs.
