The native iOS version is the ideal choice for iOS users, however it requires sideloading the app onto your device. Note that this *does not* require jailbreaking.

There are several free tools that accomplish this:

* ### [AltStore](https://altstore.io/ "AltStore")

* ### [SideStore](https://sidestore.io/ "SideStore")
