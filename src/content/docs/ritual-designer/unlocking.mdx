The Ritual Designer is available for Tier 2 and higher Hall of Osiris members.

When you first download Lilith's Guidance, the Ritual Designer as well as the Planetary Hours screen will be locked. When attempting to access these features, you will be prompted to enter a code.

To receive the code, log into Hall of Osiris. In the [Magick Tools section](https://hallofosiris.org/#/magick-tools "Magick Tools section"), you will find Lilith's Guidance under “Applications.” Click this button to reveal the code.

Once you have located the code, enter it into the Unlock menu's text box within Lilith's Guidance and press "Confirm."
The Ritual Designer will unlock, allowing you access.
It will continue to remain unlocked on your device - you do not have to enter the code again upon restarting Lilith's Guidance.

<Aside>It is possible the code will be changed periodically as new updates to Lilith's Guidance are released. Old codes will continue to work with the releases they were intended for, but new releases of Lilith's Guidance will prompt you for the latest code, assuming it has changed. Simply locate the latest code on Hall of Osiris and enter it again. </Aside>
