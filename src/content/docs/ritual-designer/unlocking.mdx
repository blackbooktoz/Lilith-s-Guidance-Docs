The Ritual Designer is available for Hall of Osiris members.

When you first download Lilith's Guidance, the Ritual Designer will be locked. A button labeled "Unlock" will be displayed.
Upon clicking this button, you will be prompted to enter a code.

To receive the code, log into Hall of Osiris.

Once you have located the code, enter it into the Unlock menu's text box within Lilith's Guidance and press "Confirm."
The Ritual Designer will unlock, allowing you access.
It will continue to remain unlocked on your device - you do not have to enter the code again upon restarting Lilith's Guidance.

<Aside>It is possible the code will be changed periodically as new versions of Lilith's Guidance are released. The old code(s) will continue to work on the versions they were intended for, but the new version would prompt you for the new code. Simply locate the new code on Hall of Osiris and enter it again. </Aside>
