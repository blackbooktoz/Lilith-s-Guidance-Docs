### Image & Audio
***
Accepted image formats: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`

Accepted audio formats: `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`
<br />
### Video
At this time, the only accepted video format is `.ogv`

As this is not a common file type, you may need to convert your video to it.
There are online tools that may let you do this for free, with restrictions such as file size limits, etc.

An example of such a tool: https://www.freeconvert.com/mp4-to-ogv

However, an option that is completely free and gives full control over the process is [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/ "FFmpeg").
<br />
#### FFmpeg
[After installing FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html "Download FFmpeg"), you can run commands such as this via your command line:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -c:v libtheora -q:v 7 -c:a libvorbis -q:a 5 output.ogv
```

`input_video.mp4` should be changed to the name of your video file. 

`output.ogv` will be the name of the converted video file.

`-q:v 7` sets the video quality of the converted video on a scale from 0 to 10.

`-q:a 5` sets the audio quality of the converted video on a scale from 0 to 10.

Additional settings that may be helpful are frame rate and video dimensions. An example command with these settings added:
```bash
ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -c:v libtheora -q:v 7 -c:a libvorbis -q:a 5 -r 30 -vf "scale=1024:576" output.ogv
```

`-r 30` sets the frame rate.

`-vf "scale=1024:576"` sets the video dimensions.
