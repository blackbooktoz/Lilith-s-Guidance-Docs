### Image & Audio
***
Accepted image formats: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .webp

Accepted audio formats: .mp3, .wav, .ogg
<br />
### Video
At this time, the only accepted video format is .ogv

As this is not a common file type, you may need to convert your video to it.
There are online tools that may let you do this for free, with restrictions like file size limits, etc.

However, an option that is completely free and gives full control over the process is [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/ "FFmpeg").

#### FFmpeg
After installing FFmpeg, you can run commands like these via your command line:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -c:v libtheora -q:v 7 -c:a libvorbis -q:a 5 output.ogv
```

"input_video.mp4" would be changed to the name of your video. 

"output.ogv" would be the name of the converted video file.

"-q:v 7" sets the video quality of the converted video on a scale from 0 to 10.

"-q:a 5" sets the audio quality of the converted video on a scale from 0 to 10.

Additional settings that may be helpful are frame rate and video dimensions. An example with these settings added:
```bash
ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -c:v libtheora -q:v 7 -c:a libvorbis -q:a 5 -r 30 -vf "scale=1024:576" output.ogv
```

"-r 30" sets the frame rate.

"-vf" sets the video dimensions, as shown.
