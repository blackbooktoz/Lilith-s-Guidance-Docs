When a textbox is selected within the Ritual Designer, you will notice a mini BBCode menu is displayed.

To the right of the BBCode menu is a "Preview" button which will deselect the textbox when pressed.
This allows the BBCode tags to instead display the actual BBCode.
For single-line textboxes, you can alternatively press the enter key on your keyboard.

The following BBCode explanations reference the [official Godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/ui/bbcode_in_richtextlabel.html#reference "official Godot documentation").

### Color Codes
***
![color constants](/color_constants.png "color constants")

When using color tags, such as `[color=red]text[/color]`, the specified color must be one of these named colors.

Alternatively, you can also specify a color using a hexidecimal code, such as `[color=#ff00ff]text[/color]`.  

The color picker (indicated by a dropper icon in the mini BBCode menu) will let you choose a color from a color wheel
and will input its hexidecimal code for you.
