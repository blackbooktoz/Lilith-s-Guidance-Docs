In the Options menu within Lilith's Guidance, you will see 2 buttons in the top-right corner of the screen: "Import Backup" and "Create Backup."
<br />
### Create Backup:
***
"Create Backup" will create a ZIP file containing the entirety of your save files. This is useful to safeguard your save data by uploading the ZIP to an external storage device or cloud storage.
<br />
### Import Backup:
***
"Import Backup" will ask you to select a ZIP folder containing your backed-up files.

<Badge text="Warning" variant="danger" /> Importing a backup will erase ALL of your current save data, if any, leaving only the files that were within your backup ZIP file.
<br />
### Moving Between Devices:
***
Another use for this feature is if you were to move to another device.
For example, say you want to move your save data from your Android to your PC. Simply create a backup from within your Android app, and import the created backup into your PC version of Lilith's Guidance.
