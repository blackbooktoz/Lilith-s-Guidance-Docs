The method to update from previous versions of Lilith's Guidance varies depending on one's device.

On mobile devices it is especially important to update correctly in order to keep your save files intact.

<br />
### Mac / Windows / Linux
***
Simply download the new version of Lilith's Guidance and run that instead. Your workings are still safely saved elsewhere on your machine.

You can also have multiple versions of the app on your PC at once, should you want this.
Just run the executable of the version of the app you wish to load into.
<br />
### Android
***
<Badge text="Warning" variant="danger" /> Do not uninstall the previous version of the app - this will delete your save files!

Instead, simply install the new version and it will automatically update your app with your save files kept intact.
<br />
### HTML5
***
This version of the app will update automatically. There is nothing you have to do on your part.
