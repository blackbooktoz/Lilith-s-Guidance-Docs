The native iOS version is the ideal choice for iOS users, however it requires sideloading the app onto your device.
Note that this *does not* require jailbreaking.

The available sideloading tools *all* require a PC for the initial setup.

The Lilith's Guidance app will also need to be refreshed every 7 days; the level of automation for this varies for each tool.
<br />
#### There are several free tools for sideloading:
***
* ### [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/ "Sideloadly")
    * Requires access to the PC to refresh the app.
    * With the Sideloadly daemon running on the PC, the app can be automatically refreshed wirelessly or via USB.
    * For refreshing wirelessly, your device must be on the same Wi-Fi network as the PC.
***
* ### [AltStore](https://altstore.io/ "AltStore")
    * Requires access to the PC to refresh the app. 
    * With AltServer running on the PC, the app can be manually refreshed wirelessly or via USB.
    * For refreshing wirelessly, your device must be on the same Wi-Fi network as the PC.
***
* ### [SideStore](https://sidestore.io/ "SideStore")
    * *Does not* require access to the PC after initial setup.
    * Can refresh apps directly on your device (typically by using a VPN and Wi-Fi) after the initial computer-based installation.
