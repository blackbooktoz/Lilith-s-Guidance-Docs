The native iOS version is the ideal choice for iOS users, however it requires sideloading the app onto your device.
Note that this *does not* require jailbreaking.

However, the available sideloading tools *all* require a PC for the initial setup.

The Lilith's Guidance app will also need to be refreshed every 7 days. The level of automation for this varies for each tool.
<br />
#### There are several free tools for sideloading:
***
* ### [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/ "Sideloadly")
    * Requires access to the PC to refresh the app.
    * Requires the Sideloadly daemon running on a PC to automatically refresh apps wirelessly or via USB.
***
* ### [AltStore](https://altstore.io/ "AltStore")
    * Requires access to the PC to refresh the app. 
    * Requires AltServer to be running on a PC on the same Wi-Fi network, or the device to be connected via USB.
***
* ### [SideStore](https://sidestore.io/ "SideStore")
    * Does not require access to the PC after initial setup.
    * Can refresh apps directly on the device, typically using a VPN and Wi-Fi after the initial computer-based installation.
